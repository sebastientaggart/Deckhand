  - Builtin plugin with `ui.open_url` action and `camera.motion` signal
  - Plugin registry for accessing core components

- **Action and Signal Registries**
  - Named action routing with payload validation
  - Signal webhook ingestion
  - Metadata support (description, payload schema) for self-documenting APIs
  - Discovery endpoints (`GET /actions`, `GET /signals`)

- **State Store**
  - In-memory key-value store for UI indicators
  - TTL (time-to-live) support for temporary state
  - Automatic expiration and purging
  - `state.changed` and `state.cleared` events

- **Event Bus**

  - Standardized error event format
  - Source attribution for all events

- **Configuration Support**
  - TOML configuration file loading
  - Environment variable overrides
  - Bindings file loading (JSON)

  - Test fixtures for easy plugin testing

- **Documentation**
  - Plugin author guide (`docs/PLUGIN_GUIDE.md`)
  - Stream Deck client integration guide (`docs/STREAMDECK_CLIENT.md`)
  - Complete API reference (`docs/API.md`)
  - Event schema reference (`docs/EVENTS.md`)
  - Example plugin template (`examples/example_plugin.py`)

- **Agent Abstraction**
  - Base agent interface

### Architecture

- **Thin Client, Smart Core**: UI clients are dumb terminals; orchestration lives in service
- **Bidirectional by Default**: Events streamed via WebSocket; no polling required
- **Plugin-Friendly**: Extensible via Python modules
- **Local-First**: Service runs locally; prefer LAN/local APIs
- **Composable Actions**: Buttons trigger named actions; signals ingest external events

### API Stability

- Event schema versioned (`version: "1.0"`)
- API endpoints frozen for v1.0.0
- Backward-compatible changes only in future minor versions
